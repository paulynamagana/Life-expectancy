# Admission Data
 
Create a deep learning regression model that predicts the likelihood that a student applying to graduate school will be accepted based on various application factors (such as test scores).

admissions_data.csv, contains parameters that admissions officers commonly use to evaluate university applicants. This data is from Kaggle and provides information about 500 applications for various universities and what their chance of admittance is.

This is a regression problem because the probability of being admitted is a continuous label between 0 and 1.
